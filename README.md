## Introduction
This repository is for all my Tech Academy JavaScript projects. 
## Projects:
* Pizza Menu
* Tic-Tac-Toe Game
* Calculator

## [Pizza Menu]()
This Project is a menu to order pizza with a various selection of toppings. It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.
## [Tic-Tac-Toe Game]()
The classic game of tic-tac-toe. It randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game (with a twist, chess pieces). Users can decide which token each player wants to use and the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.
## [Calculator]()
A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
